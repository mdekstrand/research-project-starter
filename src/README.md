# Project Source

This directory contains the primary source code for the project.  It often
consists of a single Python package (a directory containing an `__init__.py`
file along with various Python modules).

With the default setup, these packages will be installed into the Python virtual
environment, so they can be imported **without** importing from a `src` package.
